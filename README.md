~~A JavaScript framework for Serial communication.~~

A little (WIP) program to transfer Xbox 360 gamepad input data to virtual
COM port for use by development board controlling a robot. It is designed
to convert gamepad input into commands like setting motors' speed or toggling
a certain servo. I am using `xboxdrv` userspace driver.
